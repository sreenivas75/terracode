# Bringing existing infrastructure under Terraform's control involves five main steps:
- Identify the existing infrastructure to be imported.
- Import infrastructure into your Terraform state.
- Write Terraform configuration that matches that infrastructure.
- Review the Terraform plan to ensure the configuration matches the expected state and infrastructure.
- Apply the configuration to update your Terraform state.
